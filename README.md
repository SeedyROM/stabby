## Goal:

Create a 2D hack 'n' slash game, taking the principals from my XNA/FNA/Monogame prototype and use something more platform indepedent and requires no Visual Studio build tool chaining for assets.

## What needs to be implemented:
- [x] Separate engine from game code via CMake.
- [x] Setup Conan.
- [x] Initial project setup with Conan and SDL2/GLAD/GLM.
- [ ] Create reproducable builds with Makefile/make.bat script code.
- [ ] Create simple sprite renderer using OpenGL.
- [ ] Refactor/move my C# ECS implementation into C++23.
- [ ] Resource loading.
- [ ] Audio system.
- [ ] Immediate mode UI basics.
- [ ] **Initial game play using the following setup!**.
  - [ ] This will probably be a stupid
